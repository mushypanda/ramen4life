# ramen4life

# trying to create a ramen place that is within a college campus that students, faculty, staff, and visitors can eat

# original goal was to have a POS (point of sale) system for patron(s) to order from that will be automatically sent to the kitchen and the chefs will know what to make for the orders and send it out to servers for the patrons
